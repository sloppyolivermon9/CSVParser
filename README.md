# CSVParser
This program parses csv files (or any file using commas ',' to separate values) and puts it into a multidimensional array
# How to use
Call function 'parseCSV(file)' and use a file directory as a parameter and it will return a multidimensional array containing all the items from the CSV.
in order to read/access these values you will need to call the array like this: TestArray[0][0] (1st line and 1st item (first index is line and second index is item in that line))
